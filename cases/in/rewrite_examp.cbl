      *  Program Abstract:
      *    This program demonstrates the use of the REWRITE verb to modify a
      *    sequential file "in place".  Specifically, the records in an Employee
      *    file are modified to reflect changes to be made to the hourly wages of
      *    some of the employees.
      *
      *  INPUT:
      *    There are two input files.  The Employee file contains a record for each
      *    employee, which includes fields for Employee ID, Name, and Hourly-Wage.
      *    The Change-Wage file contains a record for each employee whose hourly
      *    wage is to be changed.  Each such record contains an Employee ID and
      *    the new hourly wage of the corresponding employee.  It is assumed that
      *    each file is ordered according to its Employee ID field and that any such
      *    ID occurring in the Change-Wage file also occurs in the Employee file.
      *    (These assumptions are vital in that the program will not work correctly
      *    if the input files fail to satisfy the stated conditions.)
      *
      *  OUTPUT:
      *    The Employee file is updated so that the Hourly-Wage field in the
      *    appropriate records are modified in accord with the Change-Wage file.
      *    A message is displayed indicating the changes that are being made
      *    to the file.
      *
